## Introduction
This is a fork of [szzhiyang's PerfectWindows](https://github.com/szzhiyang/PerfectWindows). The original version had its AHK scripts removed, so this version is designed for users who enjoy customizing their own keyboard shortcuts. If you prefer a polished, ready-to-use productivity tool, I recommend exploring the original repository. It offers an exceptional keyboard experience, even surpassing Vim keybindings. Kudos to szzhiyang, who also provides a macOS version!

The scripts have been updated to AHK v2 format, with minor modifications to suit my personal workflow.

## Usage
1. Install [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Run `power_keys.ahk`.
